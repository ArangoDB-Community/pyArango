Python Object Wrapper for ArangoDB_ with built-in validation
=============================================================

pyArango aims to be an easy to use driver for ArangoDB with built in validation. Collections are treated as types that apply to the documents within. You can be 100% permissive or enforce schemas and validate fields on set, on save or on both.

pyArango supports graphs, indexes and probably everything that arangodb_ can do.

pyArango is developed by `Tariq Daouda`_, the full source code is available from github_.
